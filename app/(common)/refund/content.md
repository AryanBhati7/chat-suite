Refund Policy
Pivot With AI: Commitment to Your Satisfaction
Last Updated: December 6, 2024
Thank you for using ChatSuite by Pivot With AI. Your satisfaction is our priority, and we strive to ensure a seamless experience with our services. This Refund Policy outlines the conditions under which refunds may be granted for Pay-As-You-Go usage and, where applicable, future subscription plans.

1. Pricing Models
   Currently, Pivot With AI operates on a Pay-As-You-Go pricing model for ChatSuite. This allows users to pay only for the services they consume, ensuring flexibility and cost-efficiency. In the future, we may introduce subscription plans, and this policy will be updated to reflect such changes.

2. Refund Conditions
   Refunds are issued only under the following circumstances:
   2.1 Technical Issues
   If you encounter persistent technical issues that prevent you from using the credits or services you purchased, and our support team is unable to resolve the issue within a reasonable timeframe, you may be eligible for a refund.
   2.2 Non-Delivery of Service
   If you purchase credits or services and the system fails to deliver them (e.g., credits are not added to your account or features are inaccessible), you may request a refund.
   2.3 Billing Errors
   Refunds will be issued if you are charged incorrectly due to a system error or unauthorized charges are made to your account.

3. Refund Exclusions
   Refunds will not be provided under the following circumstances:
   Change of Mind: Refunds are not issued for unused credits or services if you change your mind about using ChatSuite.
   Exhaustion of Credits: Pay-As-You-Go credits that have been used are non-refundable.
   Expiration of Credits: If purchased credits have an expiration date (to be specified in future updates), unused credits beyond this period are non-refundable.
   Violation of Terms: Refunds will not be granted if your account is terminated for violating our Terms of Service.
   Third-Party Issues: Problems caused by third-party integrations, networks, or systems beyond our control are not eligible for refunds.

4. Future Subscription Plans
   When subscription plans are introduced, the following refund terms will apply:
   Pro-Rated Refunds: For subscriptions canceled mid-cycle, refunds may be issued for the unused portion of the subscription period, depending on the plan terms.
   Trial Periods: If a subscription plan includes a free trial, refunds will not be issued for charges incurred after the trial period ends unless covered under the conditions above.
   Details about future subscription refunds will be explicitly outlined upon the introduction of these plans.
